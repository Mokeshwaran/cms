# CMS - Class Management System

This app serves as a manual location system that doesn't use GPS. This app serves mainly for university professors and school teachers by locating them within an assigned class.
This is a complete app with plethora of updates to come.

## Future Updates:
1. Fingerprint Authentication.
2. Notification System.
3. Time Table Management\*.
4. Smooth UI and more...

### \*Time Table Management:
  In future I will be implementing school/university time tables which will be useful for Head of Department or the higher order faculties, where they observe other faculties and assign them a class when there is an empty class or swap classes within faculties using _Notification System_.
